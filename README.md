# Line-follower-bot

Line follower bot using Arduino UNO.

Components required for building the project are :

1> 1 X Arduino UNO 

2> 3 X IR Sensor Module

3> 2 X Geared DC Motor

4> 1 X Motor Driver Module

5> 2 X Wheels

6> 1 X Robot Chassis

7> 1 X Castor Wheel

8> Jumper Wires (male/female)

9> Nut-Bolts

10> 1 X 9V-battery/Powerbank

Assemble the robot using the above-mentioned components.
Fix the IR sensor module at appropriate height and distance on the Chassis of the robot.
Burn the Above code on Arduino UNO using Arduino IDE & change the value of threshold in your
program accordingly so that the sensors are able to differentiate between the white part & the
black line of your track. For better performance & longer battery use powerbank.
